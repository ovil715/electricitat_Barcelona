### Explanation

This is the project I submitted as part of the bootcamp <i>Upskilling: Business Intelligence with Power BI</i> at [ITAcademy-Barcelona Activa](https://itacademy.barcelonactiva.cat/).

The project attempts to explore electricity consumption in the city of Barcelona during the year 2022. To that purpose, it uses data pulled from [Open data - Ajuntament de Barcelona](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/es). The dataset presents the data consumption during that year segmented by zip code, date, time frame and economic sector.

In order to add a bit more context to the data, it was complemented with temperature data extracted from [AEMET](https://opendata.aemet.es/centrodedescargas/inicio), relative to the daily records during the same period at Observatori Fabra (one of two weather stations at Barcelona). 

The project is presented twice. The PBIx file named <i>Informe</i> presents the findings in form of a report; it follows principles of thematic consistency and descending granularity to attempt to give the viewer an in depth look at the data. Due to the extension of this version (8 pages), there are redundancies in the presentation designed to not make the reader switch slides all the time, and a great amount of care is taken to avoid misreadings, for instance, due to scaling differences in side-by-side graphs.

On the other side, the PBIx file named <i>Dashboard</i> attempts, as the name implies, to present the same information as an interactive one-page dashboard. To that end, it makes use of a several number of Power BI capabilities such as CALCULATE filters, field parameters and visual interaction controls.
